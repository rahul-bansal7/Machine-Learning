# Machine-Learning
### This is all my work I've done on Machine learning
### 1.This file contains bank analysis model using logistic regression.
### 2.The project has been built using two algorithm:

Naive Bayes- The accuracy achieved is not very good using theis model.
Logistic Regressino- The accuracy achieved is great.

### 3.This is a classification problem which predicts whether a person has Diabetes or not

### 4.The file contains the EDA of the data.

Vatious models used in the modelling of the data are:
a)Logistic Regression
b)SVM with Linear Kernel
c)SVM with RBF Kernel
d)Decision Tree
e)KNN


The best performing model is KNN with n_neighbours=2.


### 5.The model used in the data are SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
The best performing model is SVM using the poly kernal.

### 6. The following folder contains project related to unsupervised Machine Learning.
